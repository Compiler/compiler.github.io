			<h2>Forgotten projects</h2>
		</header>
		<p>For the first 3-4 years of programming, all my projects were stored locally and then backed up to a google drive. This was before I understood the importance of version control even in solo projects. However, even though they are old it is funny how much I would over complicate easy tasks just to see if I could. Always challenging yourself is a key part of growth-- working just outside your limits and struggling. Below I list some of the projects that I DO have on github and am excited to show you. </p>

					<h3>Learning Anything</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Having computer science under my belt in highschool inspired all sorts of knowledge I don't think I would've had without it. Things such as "I can learn anything in the world because all the information I need is online." I write more about this in my blog post.</p>

					<h3>Mentorship</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As much as I would like to say I was a brilliant kid with a talent for Computer Science, I wasn't. I wouldn't be anywhere without the help of mentors. These people are the reason I am where I am today and I want to stress how important, although not necesary, these type of people are for accelerating your successes. </p>

					<h3>Mindset</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As a freshmen in college, it was easy to blow off classes that I thought were under me, such as Intro to Java when I had already been studying Java religiously for 4 years. However, it is way more important to take those type of opportunities to help others in the class and build relationships with people who might love the field just as much as you do, that alone is important enough to give it your all and maybe learn something new.</p>

			<h2>Present day</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Now I am a senior and I feel grateful for the experiences I have been through that made me the pereson I am. Every single thing that happens can be learned from and I hope I drove home the point that many things may be out of your control or lucky/unlucky, but no matter what your mindset determines the experience.</p>
