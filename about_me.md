			<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>When I was a freshman in highschool, I started to fail my photography class for not having a camera. As sad as that is, my guidance conselor saw this and called me in to 
		move me to the only other available class: Intro to Visual Basic. I started a few weeks late at this point and had no idea that coding even existed. Suffice to say, I started doing poorly
		in that class as well. Because of this, I decided to stay after school to get some help. When my teacher realized I didn't even know what coding was, she layed out the endless possibilities of creation that coding unlocks; I was instantly hooked. I stayed after school everyday for 4-6 hours practicing because I had no computer at home. This persisted for years(the programming, I built a computer out of old parts) and hasn't slow down at all.</p>

					<h3>Learning Anything</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Having computer science under my belt in highschool inspired all sorts of knowledge I don't think I would've had without it. Things such as "I can learn anything in the world because all the information I need is online." I write more about this in my blog post.</p>

					<h3>Mentorship</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As much as I would like to say I was a brilliant kid with a talent for Computer Science, I wasn't. I wouldn't be anywhere without the help of mentors. These people are the reason I am where I am today and I want to stress how important, although not necessary, these type of people are for accelerating your successes. </p>

					<h3>Mindset</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As a freshmen in college, it was easy to blow off classes that I thought were under me, such as Intro to Java when I had already been studying Java religiously for 4 years. However, it is way more important to take those type of opportunities to help others in the class and build relationships with people who might love the field just as much as you do, that alone is important enough to give it your all and maybe learn something new.</p>

			<h2>Present Day</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Now I am a senior and I feel grateful for the experiences I have been through that made me the person I am today. Every single thing that happens can be learned from and I hope I drove home the point that many things may be out of your control or lucky/unlucky, but no matter what, your mindset determines the experience.</p>
