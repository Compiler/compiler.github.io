			<h2>Who I am</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My name is Luke Roche and I have been programming since I was 13 years old. Immediately after discovering computer science, I was obsessed. I spent countless hours programming as a kid and I have maintained that level of passion and energy to this day. Currently, I left my cushy job at Intel to grow my career at a startup. After just a few months on the job, I made massive contributions to the company and myself as an engineer.</p>

					<h3>Learning Anything</h3>

				<p>Having computer science under my belt in highschool inspired all sorts of knowledge I don't think I would've had without it. Things such as "I can learn anything in the world because all the information I need is online." I write more about this in my blog post.</p>

				<p>Mentors have the abililty to accelerate your growth on an unbelievably fast timeline. I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today without the help of my mentors. These people are the reason I am where I am today and I want to stress how important these type of people are for accelerating your success. </p>

					<h3>Mindset</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Computer science isn't just a job, career hobby; it's an art. The art is a mesmerizing tapestry woven with intricate algorithms and elegant code. The very language in which you write code is a superset of the language of the universe: mathematics & logic. The unbounded scale at which a single program can grow is what makes a single programmer so powerful. To me, being a computer scientist is the most exciting thing you can be.</p>

			<h2>Present Day</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I have spent time at Intel scaling their backend for automation. I wrote the internal structures and systems that each automation workflow is built upon on their chip inspection team. After learning a ton, I moved to a more fast pace environment to see if I couldn't accelerate my skill development. This is how I landed at Topaz Labs, where I work now. Topaz Labs is filled with brilliant people who's focused is honed to a point on user-facing product development. After just a short amount of time here, I learned so much about ownership, product quality, and code reliability. </p>
