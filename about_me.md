			<h2>Who I am</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My name is Luke Roche and I have been programming since I was 13 years old. Immediately after discovering computer science, I was obsessed. I spent countless hours programming as a kid and I have maintained that level of passion and energy to this day. .</p>

				<p>Mentors have the abililty to accelerate your growth on an unbelievably accelerated timeline. I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today without the help of my mentors: Doug Rudolph, Margaret Incantalupo, and many others.

					<h3>Mindset</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Computer science isn't just a job, career or hobby; it's an art. The art is a mesmerizing tapestry woven with intricate algorithms and elegant code. The very language in which you write code is a superset of the language of the universe: mathematics & logic. The unbounded scale at which a single program can grow is what makes a single programmer so powerful. To me, being a computer scientist is the most exciting thing you can be. My passions remain in local performance computing and GPU acceleration, as they have for the last 10+ years.</p>

			<h2>Present Day</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I have spent time at Intel scaling their backend for automation. I wrote the internal structures and systems that each of Intels Automation workflow is built upon on their chip inspection team. After learning a lot about big companies, I moved to a more fast paced environment to see if I couldn't accelerate my skill development. This is how I landed at Topaz Labs, where I work now. Topaz Labs is filled with brilliant people, where customer impact is our number one focus. After just a short amount of time here, I learned so much about ownership, product quality, and code reliability. </p>
