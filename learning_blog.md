# No matter the topic, it's surpringly easy to learn it.

What would it take to be 1% better today? Picking up a single piece of garbage? Spending _5_ minutes on something you wanna learn? It doesn't take much but these tiny tiny gains can have massive effects over time. It can seem like a stretch to think picking up a single piece of trash or those 5 minutes changing anything at all. However, these actions accumulate fast. *James Clear* has an excellent diagram that depicts this growth:


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![tiny-gains](assets/images/tiny-gains-graph.jpg){: width="600" }
{: refdef}


| Days Passed   | Year 1| Year 2    | Year 3    | 
| ----          | ----  | ----      | ----      |
| Percent Better| 37%   | 1427%     | 53939%    | 
| Percent Worse | 0.03% | 0.00065%  | 0.000017% |


This table speaks very loudly about how fast bad habits can throw us down a terrible spiral leading to being a fraction of the person we once were. However, being 1% better each day for 2 years results in being 14x the person you are today. That speaks even louder. This idea is known to me as the _Compound Effect_.
Compound Effect
 : The strategy of reaping huge rewards from small, seemingly insignificant actions.
